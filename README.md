# BudgetManager - A Budget Management System

**BudgetManager** is a simple budget management system designed to help users manage their financial data efficiently. It is built using:

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Firebase** (for backend and data storage)

## ðŸ‘¾ Features

- Add, edit, and delete budget entries.
- View a list of budgets with categories.
- User-friendly forms for inputting budget and expense information.
- All data is saved in Firebase, providing persistent storage.

## ðŸ“’ Process

I started by implementing user authentication with login and registration features. Next, I developed a budget management system, allowing users to easily add, edit, and delete budget records.

After completing the budget management feature, I focused on enhancing the overall user experience by adding visual cues and validation for data inputs. The system ensures that users have a seamless experience when managing their finances.

I styled the application using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a modern and responsive design. The design draws inspiration from popular budget management systems and best practices in UI/UX design.

All data is stored securely in Firebase, allowing users to access their information anytime.

**NOTE**: The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic budget management system and showcase the use of React and Firebase. It is not intended to be a full-fledged financial application.
